# Welcome to GitHub Pages

This is my little project with Ansible Automation.

## Core Idea

The core idea is to automate the creation of a shopping cart website using Ansible

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dearsundaram/AnsibleApache/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
